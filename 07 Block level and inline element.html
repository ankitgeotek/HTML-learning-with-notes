    <h3>Block Level Elements</h3>    
    <p>
        A block level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).


        <!--
            Examples:
                <address>
                <article>
                <aside>
                <blockquote>
                <canvas>
                <dd>
                <div>
                <dl>
                <dt>
                <fieldset>
                <figcaption>
                <figure>
                <footer>
                <form>
                <h1> - <h6>
                <header>
                <hr>
                <li>
                <main>
                <nav>
                <noscript>
                <ol>
                <p>
                <pre>
                <section>
                <table>
                <tfoot>
                <ul>
                <video>
                <>
                <>
                <>

    <h3>Inline Element</h3>
    <p>An Inline element does not starts with a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary</p>

    <!--
        Examples
            <a>
            <abbr>
            <b>
            <br>
            <button>
            <cite>

    <p>
        This is a<div style="border: 2px red solid; color: green;">div-"A Block level element"</div>at the paragraph level 
        everythig shoul print at the same line but as we used div here wihic is a block level element so- line 
        will break a text inside the div will preint in completely new line and the div will take 100% of width 
        and text after the div will print in the next line
    </p>




    <p>
        This is a<span style="border: 2px red solid; color: green;">span-"an inline element"</span>at the paragraph level 
        everythig will print at the same line as we used span here which is a inline element so- line 
        will not break, a text inside the span will print continously in the same line and the span will take only that much space which it requires

    </p>
